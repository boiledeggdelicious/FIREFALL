                Horsetail Fall, located in Yosemite National Park in California,
                is a seasonal waterfall that flows in the winter and early spring.<br>
                The fall occurs on the east side of El Capitan.

                This natural Firefall is one of Yosemite National Park's
                most amazing spectacles.<br> Around the second week of February,
                the setting sun hits Horsetail Fall at just the right angle
                to illuminate the upper reaches<br> of the waterfall. 
                And when conditions are perfect, Horsetail Fall glows orange and red at sunset.
                This natural phenomenon is<br> often referred to as the
                <b>"Firefall"</b>,
                a name that pays homage to 
                <a href="website2.html">Yosemite Firefall</a>,
                the manmade event that once took place in <br>Yosemite.</font></p><br>

           <h3>HOW THE FIREFALL OCCURS</h3>
           <p> <font face="Calibri Light">
            The waterfall is fed by rain or snowmelt.
            It descends in two streams side by side, the eastern one being the larger but both<br> quite small.
            It can be seen and photographed from a small clearing close to the picnic area on the north road
            leading out of<br> Yosemite Valley east of El Capitan.<br><br>
            For a couple of weeks around mid-February, the fall
            may be lit up by the setting sun, creating the illusion of a blazing waterfall.<br>
            This evening spectacle, which lasts around 10 minutes in good viewing conditions,
            is commonly referred to as the <b>"Firefall"</b>.<br>
            The firefall phenomenon requires sufficient snowfall,
            a warm enough temperature to melt the snow so that there is enough<br>
            water to create the fall, a clear sky, and the right angle for the sunlight
            to illuminate the fall. It is not always observable every year.<br><br>
