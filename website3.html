            <dt><h4>The perfect alignment of the sun, the waterfall and the viewer.</h4></dt>
            <dd>The sun comes into position in mid-to-late February each year, so if you're
                in the right place, that's when the magic will happen.<br> More on the best time
                and place to view the natural Yosemite firefall effect in a bit.</dd>

            <dt><h4>Enough water in Horsetail Fall</h4></dt>
            <dd>In order to get a nice flow in Horsetail Fall a few different things
                need to happen. One, there has to be some snow on the ground<br> to provide
                the water for the waterfall. Second, it needs to be warm enough during 
                the day that the sun melts that snow and sends<br> it running over the edge
                of the fall. If it is exceptionally cold, the cliff surrounding the waterfall
                will still light up, and the trickle<br> of water coming over the edge will 
                reflect the setting sun, but you won't see the stream of molten fire unless
                there is more water.</dd>

            <dt><h4>Clear skies for the Yosemite National Park Firefall</h4></dt>
            <dd>With the sun in the right place, and enough water in Horsetail Fall
                to catch the sun, the firefall can still fail to materialize if cloud<br> 
                cover blocks the sun during the critical minutes of the evening.
                For that reason, a cloudy forecast will keep many people away.<br>
                However, if that cloudy forecast clears just enough to let the right
                beam of sunlight through, you can end up with a one-of-a-kind<br> image
                with the firefall surrounded by brilliant pink clouds.</dd>

            <dt><h4>When's the best time to see the Yosemite Firefall?</h4></dt>
            <dd>During the latter half of February, the magical moment itself occurs around
                5 to 15 minutes before sunset. However, you should<br> plan to invest several
                hours to get to the right place in time. The days when the photographer 
                Galen Rowell could spot the firefall<br> effect from his car, find a convenient
                pull-out and set up for an image are long gone.<br><br>

                People visit Yosemite National Park from all over the country 
                for the natural firefall event. That means that they are finding
                their <br>spot and setting up their tripods earlier and earlier in 
                the day in order to get just the angle they want. In order to 
                navigate the parking situation and have enough time to walk out 
                to a place where you can see the firefall, plan to arrive in the
                valley in the late morning or early afternoon.<br><br>
                
                Spend the time relaxing and enjoying the already-majestic Yosemite scenery,
                and get to know the people around you.</dd>

            <dt><h4>Where do I need to go to see the natural Yosemite firefall effect?</h4></dt>
            <dd>There is one designated location to view the natural Yosemite firefall on the eastern 
                edge of El Capitan on the valley floor. However, with the thousands of people who 
                arrive each year hoping to see Horsetail Fall glowing, the logistics that surround
                getting to one of the classic viewing areas are becoming more complex.</dd>

            <dt><h4>El Capitan Picnic Area</h4></dt>
            <dd>The El Capitan Picnic Area is one of the most popular destinations
                 for Yosemite firefall viewers and is closest to the location where 
                Galen Rowell took that first now-legendary photograph. It's also one
                of the closest viewing spots, so if you don't have a long telephoto
                lens, this will probably be your best bet.</dd>
