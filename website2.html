            The Yosemite Firefall was a summer time event that began in 1872
            and continued for almost a century, in which burning<br> hot embers
            were spilled from the top of Glacier Point in Yosemite National Park
            to the valley 3,000 feet (900 m) below.<br> From a distance it appeared
            as a glowing waterfall. <br><br>The owners of the Glacier Point Hotel conducted
            the firefall. History has it that David Curry, founder of Camp Curry, would<br>
            stand at the base of the fall, and yell "Let the fire fall," each night as a signal
            to start pushing the embers over.<br><br>
            The Firefall ended in January 1968, when George B. Hartzog, then the director of
            the National Park Service, ordered it to stop<br> because the overwhelming number of
            visitors that it attracted trampled the meadows, and because it was not a natural
            event.<br> The NPS wanted to preserve the valley, returning it to its natural state.
            The Glacier Point Hotel was destroyed by fire 18 months<br> later and was not rebuilt.
            The Firefalls were performed at 9 p.m. seven nights a week as the final act of a
            performance at<br> Camp Curry.</font>

        <p><font face="Calibri Light">
            Just 5 years after the Yosemite Firefall ended in 1973,
            a talented adventure photographer named Galen Rowell accidentally<br>
            stumbled across a new firefall-like phenomenon.
            As he was driving out of the valley on Southside Drive,
            he spotted a small<br> waterfall off the shoulder of El Capitan 
            that looked molten in the setting sun. He leaped out of his car
            and ran to photograph<br> <b>the first widely-circulated color picture
            of the natural firefall</b> in Yosemite National Park.<br><br>
            With the image of the falling bonfire at Glacier Point
            a recent memory, of course the new natural phenomenon
            has been<br> dubbed the natural Yosemite firefall.
